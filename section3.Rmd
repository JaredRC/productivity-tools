## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# a sample code chunk
```{r}
summary(pressure)
```

# When echo=FALSE, code will be hided in output file
```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```

# use a descriptive name for each chunk for debugging purpose
```{r pressure-summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```
